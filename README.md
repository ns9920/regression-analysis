    <h1>Regression Analysis</h1>
    <p>This repository contains R scripts for performing regression analysis on two datasets: Advertising and Auto. The scripts explore the datasets, build linear regression models, and evaluate their performance.</p>
    <h2>Datasets</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Advertising Dataset</strong>
            <p>The Advertising dataset contains data on sales, TV advertising budget, radio advertising budget, and newspaper advertising budget for a company. The goal is to build a linear regression model to predict sales based on the advertising budgets.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Auto Dataset</strong>
            <p>The Auto dataset provides information about various car models, including miles per gallon (mpg), cylinders, displacement, horsepower, weight, acceleration, year, and origin. The objective is to create a linear regression model to predict mpg based on the other variables.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Usage</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Clone the repository:
            <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/ns9920/regression-analysis.git</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>Navigate to the project directory:
            <pre><code>cd regression-analysis</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>Open the R script file corresponding to the dataset you want to analyze (e.g., <code>advertising_analysis.R</code> or <code>auto_analysis.R</code>).</li>
        <li>Follow the instructions in the script to load the dataset, explore the data, and build the linear regression models.</li>
        <li>The script will generate output and visualizations to help you understand and evaluate the regression models.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Dependencies</h2>
    <p>This project requires the following R packages:</p>
